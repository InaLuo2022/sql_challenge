# sql_challenge
## The task is to do a SQL analysis about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.

### Data Modelling - 
ERD table was created to sketch tables’ relationship with primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. It shows in the screenshot ERD.png

### Data Engineering
Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. The SQL file is saved as 'EmployeeSQL\Table_Schemata_SQL.sql'. The table schema specifies the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
